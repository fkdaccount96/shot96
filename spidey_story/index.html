            <h2>Chapter 1: Womanizer – Mary Jane</h2>
            The rain poured heavily, soaking both Mary Jane and Spider-Man as he swooped in to save her from the thugs
            in
            the dark alley. After he disappeared, she found herself standing in the rain, looking around for the mysterious
            hero. Her heart pounded, not just from the adrenaline, but because she had something on her mind. She wanted to
            thank him.
            Just then, Spider-Man appeared, hanging upside down in front of her, his suit drenched and dripping with
            rainwater.
            His face was hidden by the mask, but his presence was undeniable. Mary Jane, wearing an intricately designed
            black-and-gold saree, approached him, her outfit clinging to her damp body. Her saree was adorned with golden
            floral
            patterns and a shimmering gold waist belt cinching her waist. The fabric clung to her curves, accentuating her
            figure. Rain traced drops down her bare shoulder and slender arm, her bangles glinting in the dim light. Her
            long
            hair was wet and cascading in waves, framing her confident expression.
            "Thank you," she said softly, stepping closer to him. Her fingers reached up, pulling his mask down just enough
            to
            reveal his lips.
            <br><br>
            Spider-Man looked surprised, his breath catching in his throat. Mary Jane’s eyes held a teasing spark as she cupped
            his
            face, her touch gentle but firm.
            "You saved me," she whispered. "And now I think I should return the favor... with a kiss."
            Her fingers stroked his jaw, her thumb brushing over his lips. Spider-Man's heart raced, unsure of what was
            happening, but he couldn't pull away.
            "How will you repay me?" he asked, his voice hoarse.
            With a slow, sultry smile, she responded, “I have a way of relieving you from your superhero duties... if you’re
            willing to accept.”
            He raised an eyebrow, his confusion apparent. “What do you mean?”
            Mary Jane’s smile deepened as she teased him. “I can take your powers away with a kiss, Spider-Man. I’ll kiss you,
            and
            you’ll become a woman. How do you like that idea?”
            Spider-Man blinked, unsure if she was joking. “I don’t believe you,” he said, shaking his head. “But if that’s
            really true, I’ll make a bet with you. If you manage to take my powers away, I’ll wear your costume for the
            night."
            Mary Jane considered the challenge, her lips curling into a playful grin. "Deal," she agreed. "But if I win, you’ll
            have
            to kiss me again. More... passionately."
            They both nodded in agreement, the tension between them growing with each passing second.
            Mary Jane leaned in, her lips brushing lightly over his. Then she deepened the kiss, coaxing her tongue into his
            mouth.
            He moaned, her kiss so intoxicating that he forgot everything else. As she pulled back for a moment, she gave
            his
            lips a teasing tug with her teeth.
            "Get down here," she murmured. "I want to make sure you lose those powers completely."
            Spider-Man let go of his webbing, his body descending to the ground in front of her. She cupped his half-exposed
            face in her hands, her fingers gripping his lips, making him moan softly. She wrapped her other arm around his
            waist, pulling him closer to her.
            "Hold on to my belt," she instructed, her voice low and commanding.
            As she kissed him again, she felt something stirring beneath his suit. His body was changing, shrinking
            slightly.
            She could feel it—his transformation was beginning.
            Her lips parted from his for a brief moment. Spider-Man now stood shorter than her, on his toes, his eyes level
            with
            her lips. He was beginning to feel more vulnerable, and Mary Jane could sense his discomfort. But she wasn’t about
            to
            let him escape.
            <br><br>
            "Such a little girl now," she teased, her fingers sliding down to his chest, giving his newly-formed breasts a
            gentle squeeze. To her surprise, he gasped, a small shiver running through him as milk seeped through his suit.
            “Looks like your body’s reacting to me, Spider-Man. You've become so... delicate.”
            She cupped his neck, lifting his face to meet her gaze. “Such a beautiful neck... I could snap it like a twig,”
            she
            whispered, her voice dripping with dominance. "Can't believe you’re losing everything to me, little Spider."
            With a swift motion, she lifted him by his armpits, his legs dangling. “Wrap your legs around me, sweet girl.
            Let me
            take your powers completely.”
            He hesitated, then did as she asked, his body still transforming in her arms. She kissed him deeply once more,
            her
            tongue exploring his mouth, while he moaned helplessly into her. As the kiss deepened, the webbing on his wrists
            began to melt away, his transformation nearing completion.
            Pulling back from the kiss, she stared at him, cupping his face with her hands. “Such a damsel in distress
            you’ve
            become, Spider-Man. I can’t wait to strip away that suit and finish what we’ve started.”
            Her kiss turned hard and possessive, biting his lips with confidence. The transformation was almost complete,
            and
            Spider-Man’s body went limp in her arms. He was unconscious from the intensity of her kiss, his head resting
            against
            her chest.
            Mary Jane chuckled softly, looking down at him. “So, you like to drool on my breasts now, hmm?” she teased, her
            hands
            gently stroking his hair. She lowered him further into her cleavage, causing the saree pleats to slip slightly.
            "Go ahead," she whispered, “kiss between my breasts... for saving you from your superhero life."
            In his unconscious state, Spider-Man complied, kissing her as best he could. Mary Jane hummed softly, stroking his
            head.
            <br><br>
            “Once we’re home, I’ll feed you properly, my little spider.”
            Her voice was full of teasing affection as she held his limp body in her arms, feeling a sense of power and
            dominance over him. “I love how you’re becoming mine, Spider-Man. You’re my superhero now.”
            She glanced at his suit, tracing the fabric with her fingers. “I can’t wait to strip you of this suit, taste
            some of
            your milk, and wear it myself,” she said with a sly grin.
            With that, she leaned in, biting his lips one last time before raising her arm. She shot a web from her wrist, a
            golden thread glistening in the rain. Holding him tightly, she swung them both toward her home, her laughter
            echoing
            through the stormy night.

            <h2>Chapter 2: Spider Woman to the Rescue</h2>
            Mary Jane swung gracefully through the rain-soaked city, her drenched saree clinging to her toned frame. The water
            streamed down her exposed midriff, glistening
            against the golden waist belt as she held the unconscious, feminized Spiderman securely against her hip. His
            limp
            body, now delicate and petite, rested in her arms like a child’s. She landed softly on the terrace of her
            apartment,
            the storm still raging around them.
            “Mmm, look at you,” Mary Jane purred, tilting her head with a mischievous grin. “Your half-masked face is still
            buried
            in my breasts. Feeling cozy there, little girl?” She gently pulled his face out from the snug curve of her
            cleavage,
            leaving his lips parted in a weak moan. Rainwater trickled down her cheek as she gazed at his dazed expression,
            his
            lips pink and swollen from her earlier kiss.
            She ran her fingers along his jawline. “I think it’s time I strip that mask completely and see who you really
            are.
            And while I’m at it, I might as well take over this suit of yours. Someone as weak and helpless as you doesn’t
            deserve it anymore.” <br><br>Mary Jane lowered him carefully to the ground, trying to get him to stand on his own, but his
            legs
            wobbled, his reduced height making him even less stable. He barely had the strength to stay upright.
            “Oh, poor hero,” she teased, her tone dripping with mock pity. “Is the girl you saved too much for you? Did she
            drain all the spiders out of you?” She smirked as he swayed unsteadily. “No worries, little girl. You’ve carried
            me
            so many times before—like a knight in shining armor. Now, it’s my turn to carry you.”
            Without hesitation, Mary Jane scooped him up in a bridal carry, his head lolling weakly against her shoulder. She
            leaned
            down, playfully nipping at his chest through his suit. Her teeth tugged gently at his newly formed breast,
            eliciting
            a soft, breathless moan. The fabric of his suit gave just enough resistance before she released him, watching
            his
            chest jiggle from the sudden motion. “I can’t wait to taste the milk you’re hiding in there,” she whispered,
            biting
            her lip with anticipation.
            With her newfound dominance, Mary Jane carried him into her apartment, her soaked saree clinging tighter to her
            curves.
            Water dripped from her long hair as she stepped into the room, her heels clicking against the floor. She paused
            for
            a moment, admiring the lifeless body in her arms, his delicate features contrasting against the strength she
            radiated. <br><br>“You look so small and pathetic like this,” she mused, a glint of triumph in her eyes. “What a damsel
            in
            distress you’ve become.”
            Holding him close, she leaned down and pressed her lips to his, savoring the taste of rain and vulnerability.
            Her
            hand gripped the strands of his mask, pulling his face deeper into the kiss. He let out a faint, muffled moan,
            his
            legs twitching weakly against her as she kissed him with an intensity that left him breathless. Changing her
            hold,
            Mary Jane wrapped her arms around his waist, lifting him slightly off the ground, their soaked bodies pressed
            together.
            His arms and legs dangled uselessly as she ravaged his lips, her dominance overwhelming his fragile state.
            When she finally pulled away, his lips were swollen and trembling. She chuckled, tilting his chin up to meet her
            gaze. “Do you know why I’m not thanking you for saving me, little girl? Because I don’t need to. You don’t
            deserve
            gratitude—not anymore. You’ve lost everything that made you Spiderman. Look at you now—so powerless, so
            delicate,
            so… feminine.”
            She spun him lightly in her arms, inspecting his limp body with a smirk. “You’re nothing but a doll in my
            hands,”
            she continued, her voice laced with mockery. “Those swollen, beautiful pink lips… those big, round breasts…” Her
            fingers brushed against his chest, tracing the soft curves beneath the suit. “Oh, how they tempt me. But you’ll
            soon
            understand why I’m treating you this way.”
            With surprising ease, she hoisted him higher, his body weightless in her grip. Supporting his head with one
            hand,
            Mary Jane let his legs dangle freely as she teased him further. <br><br>Without warning, her knee gently nudged between his
            thighs, earning a faint whimper from the exhausted hero. “What’s this?” she teased,
            raising an eyebrow. “Is that your new feminine feature? How pathetic you’ve become without your powers.”
            Mary Jane carried him to her room, her steps purposeful as she approached the satin-covered bed. “You’ve saved me
            countless times, but now, it’s my turn to put you to bed,” she said, a mischievous edge to her voice. With one
            smooth motion, she tossed him onto the bed, his body landing softly against the plush fabric. His breasts
            jiggled
            slightly as he settled, his chest rising and falling with shallow breaths.
            Standing over him, Mary Jane placed her hands on her hips, her saree still clinging to her drenched figure. “Look at
            you. A helpless little girl, thrown onto my bed like the damsel you’ve become. Do you regret saving me yet?” She
            leaned down, her face inches from his as she whispered, “You should.”
            …

        <div class="chapters">
            <h2>Chapter 3: Aunt May's Arrival</h2>
            Mary Jane stood at the edge of the bed, her eyes locked onto Peter's unconscious, feminized form. The temptation to
            taste the milk from his newly developed breasts was overwhelming, but first, she had another goal. She wanted to
            unmask him. MJ pulled her golden-bordered pallu off her shoulder, wrapping it snugly around her waist along
            with
            the metallic belt. With her midriff now fully exposed, dripping with rainwater, she smirked mischievously,
            enjoying
            her dominant position.
            She leaned forward, her fingers tracing the curve of his slender neck. “Such a beautiful, delicate neck,” she
            whispered, gripping it lightly. “I could snap it with one squeeze. But not yet… first, let’s see who’s hiding
            behind
            this mask.”
            Her hand slid to the edge of his mask, peeling it away slowly and revealing his flushed, sweat-drenched face.
            MJ’s eyes widened in surprise. “Oh my god, it’s you!” she exclaimed, her voice tinged with shock and
            amusement. <br><br>
            “Peter… Peter Parker. I’ve known you since school. And now you’re the so-called hero who’s been hiding all this
            time?” She shook her head, a mix of disdain and mockery flashing across her face.
            “You were pathetic back then, and you’re still doing a pathetic job as a hero. What a waste of powers. And now…”
            She
            smirked, letting her gaze linger on his exposed features. “Now you’re nothing but a helpless little girl at my
            mercy.”
            MJ released his neck, and Peter’s body flopped back onto the bed, his breasts jiggling slightly with the
            motion.
            Amused, MJ stood tall and decided it was time to call Aunt May. She had plans—plans that involved her own
            twisted
            version of the truth.
            Grabbing her phone, she dialed Aunt May and waited for her to pick up. <br><br> “Hello, Aunt May? It’s me, MJ. Peter’s
            schoolmate.” Her tone was casual, almost sweet, but laced with hidden intentions. “I just wanted to let you
            know…
            something happened to Peter. He was harassed by a group of girls in a dark alley. Don’t worry—he’s fine now.
            Spider
            Woman saved him.”
            On the other end of the line, Aunt May sounded shocked. “Spider Woman? Isn’t it Spiderman?” she asked, confused.
            MJ chuckled. “Oh, no, Aunt May. That’s just what the Daily Bugle wants everyone to believe. But in reality…
            your
            Spiderman is a woman.” She let the words hang in the air, savoring the stunned silence. “But that’s not the real
            issue. The problem is, Peter has changed. A lot. I’ll explain everything when you get here. No need to rush—just
            come when you can, and drive carefully.”
            Without waiting for a reply, MJ ended the call and turned her attention back to Peter. He was still lying
            limp on
            the bed, his breathing shallow and uneven. MJ walked over and grabbed a fistful of his hair, lifting his head
            off
            the
            bed. His exposed face winced slightly as she forced him into a kneeling position on the satin sheets.
            “You’re awake enough for this,” MJ muttered, a cruel smile playing on her lips. In her free hand, she held
            his
            discarded mask. Slowly, she slid it into the gap of her blouse, tucking it between her breasts. “Mmm, I can feel
            the
            eyepieces pressing against my cleavage,” she teased, adjusting the mask so it fit snugly. “Soon, I’ll be wearing
            this mask on my face. And that suit of yours? It’ll belong to me. You, on the other hand, will be wearing
            something
            more… fitting.”
            Leaning closer, MJ pressed her lips against Peter’s, her kisses growing deeper and more forceful. She trailed
            her
            lips down his neck, sucking gently before pulling back with a playful grin. “Time to peel this suit off and see
            what
            you’re really hiding,” she whispered, her hands finding the edges of his suit. <br><br>
            MJ climbed onto the bed, her knees sinking into the satin sheets. She straddled Peter, her hands tugging at
            the
            fabric of his suit. Slowly, she pulled it down to his waist, revealing his milking breasts. The rest of the suit
            hung loosely around his hips like a makeshift skirt.
            MJ’s eyes widened in delight as she took in the sight before her. “Mmm, look at those round breasts of
            yours,”
            she purred, brushing her fingers over the soft, milky skin. “Dripping milk everywhere… you look so beautiful.
            And
            this slender waist…” Her hands squeezed his sides, eliciting a soft whimper from Peter. “So squishy. So
            perfect.”
            Without another word, MJ leaned back against the wall at the head of the bed, pulling Peter onto her lap. She
            positioned him so that he was straddling her, his exposed chest pressed against her face. Without hesitation,
            she
            latched onto one of his breasts, her lips closing around the nipple as she began to suck greedily.
            Peter let out a series of soft, helpless whimpers as MJ switched between his breasts, draining him of milk.
            She
            held him firmly in place, her hands gripping his waist as she continued her relentless assault. His body
            trembled
            against hers, his strength completely drained. <br><br>
            “You taste so sweet,” MJ murmured between sips, licking her lips as she pulled away momentarily. “You’re
            nothing
            but a little milkmaid now, Peter. Or should I say… Spider Girl?”
            Peter’s head lolled to the side, his breathing ragged and uneven. MJ smiled, wiping the corner of her mouth
            with
            the back of her hand. “Aunt May will be here soon,” she whispered. “But before she arrives… I think it’s time I
            take
            the rest of your suit for myself.”
            …
        </div>
        <div class="chapters">
            <h2>Chapter 4: The Truth</h2>
            MJ pulled back, her lips glistening, as she released Peter’s drained breasts. She gave his chest a firm
            squeeze,
            watching as nothing more came from him. Satisfied, she grinned and tilted his chin upward, forcing his weakened
            face
            to meet her piercing gaze.
            “You know why you’re being treated like this, don’t you?” MJ asked, her voice low and venomous. She leaned
            closer, her breath warm against his trembling lips. “It’s because of your so-called heroism—your bad decisions
            disguised as noble deeds. You’re not a hero, Peter. You’re a menace. A threat to society.”
            Peter’s lips quivered, but no words came. His eyes, glazed with exhaustion, stared back at her as she continued.
            “You think you’re saving lives?” MJ scoffed, shaking her head. “You caused more harm than good. Innocent
            people
            died because of you—because of your reckless fights. You don’t care about anyone but yourself. All you want is
            the
            glory of being called a hero.”
            She let her words sink in before leaning back and slapping his exposed breasts, making them jiggle. Peter
            flinched,
            a weak whimper escaping his lips.
            “It was all my plan,” MJ admitted with a triumphant smirk. “The alley, the girls, the rescue—it was all a
            trap. I
            wanted you to play the hero, to fall right into my web. And you did. I plotted everything, Peter. All to strip
            you
            of your powers. And now… look at you.” She gestured mockingly at his limp, feminized form. “So pathetic.”
            Peter’s head drooped, his body too weak to respond. When MJ let go of his face, he collapsed onto the bed,
            his
            chest rising and falling weakly. <br><br>MJ stood over him, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction.
            Without hesitation, she reached for the remaining fabric of his suit and tugged it down, peeling it off his
            lower
            body. The suit slid off easily, revealing his soft, feminine curves and smooth, shapely thighs. MJ tossed the
            suit aside carelessly and ran her fingers along his exposed skin.
            “You’re stunning,” she admitted, almost in awe. “More beautiful than any real girl I’ve ever seen.”
            MJ climbed off the bed, her bare feet padding against the floor as she circled around him like a predator.
            Grabbing a handful of his hair, she yanked him upward, forcing him to his feet. Peter stumbled, his legs
            wobbling as
            he struggled to stay upright.
            Mary Jane’s arms wrapped around his exposed body, her fingers tracing the contours of his waist. “This is my first
            time
            holding a girl like this,” she murmured, her voice dripping with amusement. “No clothes. Completely bare. And
            oh,
            Peter… it feels so erotic.”
            She leaned in, her lips brushing against his ear as she whispered, “Let me kiss you one last time while holding
            you
            like this.”
            Mary Jane pressed her lips against his, her kiss deep and forceful. She trailed her kisses down his neck, biting and
            sucking as she went. With a mischievous grin, she lifted him higher, her lips brushing against his midriff. Her
            kisses lingered there, playful and teasing.
            After a moment, Mary Jane set him down gently, her hands never leaving his waist. “But we can’t leave you like
            this,”
            she said, walking over to her wardrobe. Peter stood frozen, too weak to move or protest as she rummaged through
            her
            clothes.
            Finally, Mary Jane returned with an outfit—a long purple slit skirt that would reveal his thighs with every step and
            a
            pink tank top that was far too tight, designed to showcase his cleavage and midriff.
            “Here,” Mary Jane said, handing him the clothes. “Put these on. You’re not Spiderman anymore. You’re not a hero.
            You’re
            just a girl now. And you’ll dress the part.”
            Peter hesitated, his trembling hands clutching the outfit as he stared at Mary Jane in disbelief.
            “...”

            <h2>Chapter 5: Kiss of Surrender and Death of Waste Hero</h2>
            Mary Jane picked up Peter’s discarded suit from the floor, admiring how damp and heavy it felt in her hands. She ran
            her
            fingers along the fabric, imagining how
            it would look hugging her own curves. A sly smile crept across her face as she clutched the suit.
            Slowly, she unzipped the front of her black blouse. As the zipper slid downward, the mask that had been tucked
            between her breasts slipped free, tumbling to the floor. Her full, round breasts were now exposed, glistening
            from
            the lingering rain. Her fingers moved to her waist, where she unclasped the golden belt that hugged her hips.
            One by
            one, she undid the pleats of her wet saree, letting it unfold and slide down her legs. She stood there for a
            moment,
            completely bare except for her soaked inner garments.
            With deliberate movements, Mary Jane began to slip into Peter’s suit. The damp material clung to her body as she
            pulled
            it on, perfectly accentuating her curves. She ran her hands from her waist up to her chest, marveling at how
            well
            the suit hugged her form. Finally, she pulled the mask over her head, completing the transformation. She stared
            at
            her reflection in the window, striking a triumphant pose. “Spider Woman,” she whispered, reveling in her new
            identity.
            Across the room, Peter stood silently, dressed in the outfit she had chosen for him—a long purple slit skirt
            that
            clung to his hips and revealed his slender thighs, paired with the pink tank top that emphasized his cleavage
            and
            exposed his midriff. He looked every bit as gorgeous as a girl. His wet clothes clung to his delicate frame,
            making
            his transformation even more striking.
            Mary Jane turned to him with a predatory grin. Shooting a strand of web at his waist, she pulled him toward her and
            caught him in a tight embrace. In one swift motion, she scooped him up into a bridal carry, holding him
            effortlessly. The slit in his skirt revealed his slender thigh as it draped down, and his arms hung limp in her
            grip.
            “Remember,” Mary Jane said, her tone commanding, “how I unmasked your face and drained your powers while you were
            hanging upside down?” Her eyes glinted with mischief as she tightened her hold on him. “Now it’s your turn.
            Unmask
            me and kiss me—kiss me with those soft, girly lips of yours. Show me your gratitude.”
            Peter hesitated, his hands trembling as he reached for her mask. Slowly, he pulled it down, revealing Mary Jane’s
            flushed, victorious face. His lips quivered as he leaned in, pressing a tentative kiss to her lips.
            Mary Jane hummed in satisfaction, her arms tightening around him as she deepened the kiss. Pulling back, she looked
            into
            his eyes and smirked. “Now,” she commanded, “say it. Say, ‘Thank you for saving the city by transforming me into
            a
            girl. I was a bad hero, and you deserve this kiss for saving the city from me.’”
            Peter’s voice was barely above a whisper as he repeated her words, his cheeks flushed with embarrassment. “Thank
            you
            for saving the city by transforming me into a girl… I was a bad hero, and you deserve this kiss for saving the
            city
            from me.”
            Satisfied, Mary Jane chuckled softly. She kissed him again, this time with more passion, her dominance clear in
            every
            movement. She bit his lips, both upper and lower together in her teeth and tore his lips apart. Blood Oozed out on her suit and was running down his breasts.
            She smacked his teeth, making them splatter and threw him to the floor. "Thanks for the milk, let Aunt May find your body lying dead", she said and stomped his breasts
            with her new found Spider abilities. And finally she kicked on his new formed Vagina, leaking blood out of them. 
            “The great spider man is now dead! Pathetic waste of power. Come here!” she said and lifted his dead body, sucked his blood from his breasts and spit on his face.
